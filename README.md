## Simple Project showing operating system environmet variable

This simple bash script extracts the operating system's environment variables and chooses the variables including the world `PLACEHOLDER`, also convertes the results to json format. The environment variables and the selected variables are seperated in different files accordingly. To depict the outputs distinctly, I pushed them all into this repository.
When the commands are executed and the results are derived, outputs are pushed into the pre-defined github repository. You can clone this repository and change this github url in to yours.
